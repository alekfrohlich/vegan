# Udon

(1 serving)

Chopped veggies of choice
1/2 block soft tofu (optional)
1 package of pre-cooked udon noodles
1 tbsp soy sauce
1/2 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 tbsp garlic powder
1/2 tbsp sesame oil (optional)
1-2 tbsp sriracha (optional… if you don’t like spicy, omit!)
Toasted sesame seeds (optional)
Recipe

In a frying pan, cook vegetables with water or oil until slightly soft.
Crumble up the soft tofu onto the frying pan (gives it an “eggy” texture)
Add udon noodles and rest of the ingredients while continuing to mix together for a few minutes until udon noodles have separated/softened.
Top with toasted sesame seeds (optional) and enjoy.
